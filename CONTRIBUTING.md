# Contributing to MCP Operator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MCP Operator! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-operator.git
   cd mcp-operator
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/vitorbari/mcp-operator.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.23+** - [Install Go](https://go.lang.org/doc/install)
- **Docker** - For building container images
- **kubectl** - [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- **Kind** or **Minikube** - For local testing

### Install Development Tools

The Makefile will automatically install required tools:

```bash
make manifests  # Installs controller-gen if needed
make test       # Installs envtest if needed
```

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build the operator binary
make build

# Build the Docker image
make docker-build IMG=mcp-operator:dev
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation changes

### 2. Make Your Changes

#### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Run `make fmt` to format code
- Run `make vet` to check for issues
- Run `make lint` to run the linter

#### Testing Requirements

All contributions should include tests:

- **Unit tests** for business logic
- **Controller tests** for reconciliation logic
- **Integration tests** when adding new features

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run linter
make lint

# Run E2E tests (requires Kind cluster)
make test-e2e
```

### 4. Update Generated Code

If you modify the API (CRD) or controller:

```bash
# Generate CRDs, RBAC, webhooks
make manifests

# Generate deepcopy methods
make generate
```

### 5. Test Locally

Run the operator locally against your cluster:

```bash
# Install CRDs
make install

# Run the operator (development mode)
make run

# In another terminal, apply a sample
kubectl apply -f config/samples/wikipedia-http.yaml
```

Or deploy to a Kind cluster:

```bash
# Build and load image into Kind
make docker-build IMG=mcp-operator:dev
kind load docker-image mcp-operator:dev --name mcp-test

# Deploy to cluster
make deploy IMG=mcp-operator:dev

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n mcp-operator-system deployment/mcp-operator-controller-manager -f
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: support for custom health check paths

- Add HealthCheckPath field to MCPServer spec
- Update controller to configure probes with custom path
- Add tests for custom health check configuration
- Update documentation"
```

Good commit messages:
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Add details in the body if needed
- Reference issues: "Fixes #123"

### 7. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear description of changes
- Reference to related issues
- Screenshots (if UI-related)
- Test results

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`make test`)
- [ ] Linter passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`make fmt`)
- [ ] Generated code is updated (`make manifests generate`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages are clear

### PR Description Should Include

1. **What** - What does this PR do?
2. **Why** - Why is this change needed?
3. **How** - How does it work?
4. **Testing** - How was it tested?

### Example PR Template

```markdown
## Description
Adds support for custom health check paths to allow users to configure
different health check endpoints per MCPServer.

## Motivation
Some MCP servers expose health checks at non-standard paths like
`/healthz` or `/_health`. This change allows users to specify the path.

## Changes
- Added `healthCheckPath` field to MCPServer spec
- Updated controller to use custom path in probe configuration
- Added unit tests for path validation
- Updated documentation and examples

## Testing
- Unit tests: `make test`
- E2E tests: `make test-e2e`
- Manual testing with custom health check path

Fixes #42
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

**Controller tests** use Ginkgo/Gomega:

```go
Context("When reconciling MCPServer with custom transport", func() {
    It("should create Service with correct port", func() {
        // Test implementation
        Expect(service.Spec.Ports[0].Port).To(Equal(int32(9000)))
    })
})
```

**Table-driven tests** for utilities:

```go
func TestBuildLabels(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    *MCPServer
        expected map[string]string
    }{
        // Test cases
    }
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test logic
        })
    }
}
```

### Running Specific Tests

```go
# Run specific test file
go test ./internal/controller -v

# Run specific test
go test ./internal/controller -v -run TestMCPServerReconciler

# Run with coverage
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
